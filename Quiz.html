In this block of trials, the underlying relationship is that the lighter images are often more rewarding. <br> In this case, you would win 1 point on choosing the lighter image more often and 0 points on choosing the darker image. However, <strong> please note </strong> that you will not necessarily win 1 point when choosing the lighter image in this block.
